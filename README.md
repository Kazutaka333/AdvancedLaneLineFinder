## Advanced Lane Finding

Overview
---

The goals of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

How to Run the Program
---

**Step 1:** Set up the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md)

**Step 2:** Open the code in a Jupyter Notebook

`> jupyter notebook`

Click on the file called "P1.ipynb".  Another browser window will appear displaying the notebook.  

*Please check [writeup.md](https://github.com/Kazutaka333/AdvancedLaneLineFinder/blob/master/writeup.md) for detailed explanation on how this code works.*
